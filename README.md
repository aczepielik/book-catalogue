# Google Sheets Book Catalogue

I made this script some time ago to automate book cataloguing. This is very much work in progress but the basics work as intended.

## How to use

1. Write ISBN codes in the first column of the sheet.
2. Select them.
3. From "NarzÄ™dzia API" menu (yes, it's in Polish right now) select the only available option.
4. Wait until data are filled based on Polish National Library records.
